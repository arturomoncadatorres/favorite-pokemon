    "In this notebook, I will generate different visualizations of the [Favorite Pok&eacute;mon Survey](<https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/c04rvq/survey_testing_the_every_pok%C3%A9mon_is_someones/>) results. The data was collected and made public by [reddit user mamamia1001](https://www.reddit.com/user/mamamia1001/). Full credit goes to him/her. I will also be including a few comments on the results and how I interpret them. If you want a more insightful version (i.e., including the code to generate the plots), [you can find it here](./favorite_pokemon.ipynb). For more info, take a look at the [README file](../README.md). \n",

Unfortunately, we don't have those data."
